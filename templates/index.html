            <h1>Fulfilling the 5Cs of Silliman Education</h1>
            <p>
                Silliman University encourages students to grow not only in competence but also in character, faith, and service. This website is dedicated to showcasing how Iâ€™ve engaged in meaningful activities that embody the 5Cs of Silliman education, which are classroom, church, culture, court, and community. Each C represents a venue for holistic development, equipping me for a life of purpose, integrity, and positive impact.
